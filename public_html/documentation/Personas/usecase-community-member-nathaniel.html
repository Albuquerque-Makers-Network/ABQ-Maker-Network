            <p><strong>Use-case:</strong> Nathaniel wants to find someone that is able to fabricate a replacement
                 part for a broken component from an old faucet.</p>
            <p><strong>Pre-condition:</strong> Nathaniel is browsing the ABQ Maker-41 website.</p>
            <p><strong>Post-condition:</strong> Nathaniel found someone local that is able to create a 3d model of his broken faucet piece and print it with their 3d printer. He has reached out through the website for further information from this person.  </p>
            <ul>
                <lh class="fw-bold">Interaction Flow</lh>
                <li>Nathaniel spends some time scrolling through the landing page of the “Maker” site as he’s not sure what he’s looking for.</li>
                <li>Website scrolls down.</li>
                <li>None of the links on the main page seem to fill his needs, then he notices a search bar. He types “fabrication” into the search bar as he’s not sure what or who it is he’s actually looking for.</li>
                <li>The site brings up many categories from his search. He notices one for welders and metalwork. Nathaniel follows the button click to the listing for metal workers.</li>
                <li>The site brings up a list of metal workers. None of these listings seem to fit what he’s looking for. So he goes back to the search results and scrolls a little further down the list. He notices there’s a listing for “3d Printing”. He clicks on the 3d Printing button.</li>
                <li>A page comes up with about 20 Makers offering 3d printing services. He starts reading the postings. He clicks on the first listing he notices has pictures of mechanical/technical appearing 3d printed items.</li>
                <li>The site brings up a listings page. On that page, he notices a portfolio of this person’s past work. He also notices some pricing options and a review section. Nathaniel clicks on the review section.</li>
                <li>The site brings up the reviews for this Maker. He scrolls through the reviews and notices this Maker has mostly positive reviews. He then clicks on the portfolio. </li>
                <li>The site brings up the Makers portfolio of their past work. Nathaniel notices some pricing on the site but is not sure how this would apply to the faucet piece he needs to be fabricated. He notices contact e-mail on the Maker's page. He sends an email to the maker with his contact information and a brief message.</li>
                <li>Nathaniel eagerly awaits a reply from this well-reviewed local Maker!</li>
