            <p><strong>Name:</strong> Taylor Cash</p>
            <p><strong>Profession:</strong> Taylor is a full-time student who has a part-time job at World Market. He
                also does some occasional driving for Grubhub, and spends any time left over creating and selling
                match-stick art. Many of his projects are relatively small but he is currently working on an elaborate
                model of the Taj Mahal.</p>
            <p><strong>Technology Use:</strong> Taylor has an Asus laptop running Windows 10 that he primarily uses for
                school projects and e-mail. He also has a Pixel 6 Pro that he uses for photography, social media,
                youtube, and browsing the web. He has been using technology his whole life and loves how it gives him
                access to the creativity of people all around the world.</p>
            <p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong> Taylor loves connecting with new and creative people. While he
                seems to be always on-the-go between his classes and jobs, his passion is creating things with his own
                hands. Unfortunately, he does not have a lot of time to promote his work. He has tried many things, to
                include the occasional craft fair, but has not found a good way to connect with potential clients.</p>
            <p><strong>Needs:</strong> Taylor needs a way to showcase his talents to potential customers beyond the people he sees on a daily basis. He needs the connection to be simple and not consume a lot of his time because his schedule is already tight. It can't cost a lot of money because he is broke.</p>
            <p><strong>Frustrations:</strong> While events like the Albuquerque Christmas Market are nice, they cost too much money, take a lot of time, and have a limited audience for a very limited time. Taylor's work gets a positive response at those events but the long-term impact is minimal. He could sell some things on a website like Etsy but his art is fragile and shipping it across the country is a hassle. Eventually, he might go that route but for now he would like to sell products in his local area.</p>
            <p><strong>Goals:</strong> He would like a cheap, constant online presence to showcase his work to potential clients.</p>
            <p><strong>User Story:</strong> As a new artist, I need a website where I can easily showcase my art so that potential clients can easily find me. </p>
