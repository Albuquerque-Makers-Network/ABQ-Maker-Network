      <p><strong>Name:</strong> Maria Sandoval</p>
      <p><strong>Profession:</strong> Maria is a full-time welder. She works for a local metal fabricator. In her free time she makes elaborate lawn metal ornaments and sells them to friends and family. While her job pays well, she doesn't get a lot of enjoyment out of it. She would like to start making her lawn ornaments on a more regular basis and hopefully start doing so full time.</p>
      <p><strong>Technology Use:</strong> Maria has a chromebook at home that she uses to answer emails, write documents, and handle simple tasks when she needs to. It does not get used a lot. She has a Samsung Galaxy A13 that she uses for most of her online activity. She uses facebook, craigslist, and Google Chrome on her phone. She is not an avid user of technology but knows enough to get around online. </p>
      <p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong> Maria is a straightforward person. If she sees a problem, she fixes it. She enjoys working with her hands and helping others fix things around their home. She does not spend a lot of time going to public events but enjoys connecting with others via Facebook. With her full time welding job, she doesn't have a lot of time to market her lawn ornaments. </p>
      <p><strong>Needs:</strong> In order to start making lawn ornaments and other metal crafts on a more full time basis, Maria is looking for ways to connect with her community without having to attend public events such as art fairs. She isn't tech-savvy enough to build her own website and doesn't like the idea of using social media apps to market herself outside the few Facebook groups she is a part of.</p>
      <p><strong>Frustrations:</strong> Maria doesn't like using her computer and doesn't want to spend time building a brand for her lawn ornament/metal craft business. She finds marketing herself frustrating, and she doesn't want to get herself connected with her community by making videos for TikTok or Instagram. While she likes to connect with the surrounding community, she doesn't want to spend time finding and applying for craft fairs. She finds using digital media tools aggravating. </p>
      <p><strong>Goals:</strong> Maria is searching for a platform to connect with other makers and folks who may be interested in her metal crafts. She is looking for an application or web tool that would allow her to market herself without having to need to learn how to use a new, complicated social media platform or build a website.</p>
      <p><strong>User Story:</strong> As a hobbyist, I am looking for a place to connect with other people who may be interested in buying a lawn ornament from me. </p>
