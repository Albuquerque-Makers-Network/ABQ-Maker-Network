            <p><strong>Name:</strong> Nathaniel Neighbor</p>
            <p><strong>Profession:</strong> Nathaniel is an elementary school teacher at a public school.</p>
            <p><strong>Technology Use:</strong> Uses an iPhone and Mac. Nathaniel is an Apple fan and uses their technology exclusively when he is able.  He uses a Windows-based PC at school. He is a heavy internet user and researcher.</p>
            <p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong> Nathaniel does not own an automobile, he rides his bike to work.  He is also a heavy reader but prefers actual books over any sort of e-reader or app on a device for consuming books.  He is often online and involved with local community forums and message boards. Nathan tries to keep his business dealings within the local community whenever possible by buying local.</p>
            <p><strong>Needs:</strong> The nursing home Nathaniel volunteers with has an old faucet in their kitchen that has developed a leak. The faucet is not able to be replaced at an affordable cost and the part that needs replacing is no longer available. Nathaniel want's to get this faucet repaired as soon as possible.</p>
            <p><strong>Frustrations:</strong> Nathaniel loves teaching as well as learning new subjects. He is very busy with teaching at the school and his community outreach projects. He has almost no free time for personal projects.</p>
            <p><strong>Goals:</strong> Nathaniel wants to get this faucet repaired as soon as possible. He is hoping to locally source the needed part. </p>
            <p><strong>User Story:</strong> As a member from the community, I want to find someone on “The Web Makers 41” website to 3d print this broken faucet piece for the nursing home. </p>
