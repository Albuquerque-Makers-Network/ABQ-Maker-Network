      <p><strong>Post-condition:</strong> Taylor uploaded a photo of a 40-inch tall matchstick model of the Taj Mahal to his profile portfolio. He placed the new photo at the top of the portfolio and removed an old photo.</p>

        <li>Taylor selects the "Account Icon" in top-right corner of the screen.</li>

        <li>Taylor selects "Add/Remove Portfolio Elements"</li>
        <li>The site highlights the portfolio section. Each photo listed shows a small "x" on it for possible removal. Below the photos is a button titled "Upload Photo."</li>

        <li>The site shows a pop-up requesting that Taylor select where the photo is located.</li>
        <li>Taylor selects "My Phone" and then selects the specific photo.</li>
        <li>The site shows an "uploading" message and then the photo appears at the bottom of the portfolio photos stack.</li>
        <li>Taylor selects and drags the photo above the other photos because he wants it prominently displayed.</li>
        <li>The site shows the new photo at the top of the stack.</li>
        <li>Taylor sees a photo he no longer wants displayed and selects the "x" to remove it.</li>

        <li>Taylor selects "Submit."</li>
        <li>The site exits "edit mode" and displays Taylor's account page normally.</li>
