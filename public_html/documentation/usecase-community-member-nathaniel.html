            <p><strong>Use-case:</strong> Nathaniel wants to find someone that is able to fabricate a replacement
                 part for a broken component from an old faucet.</p>
            <p><strong>Pre-condition:</strong> Nathaniel is browsing the ABQ Maker-41 website.</p>
            <p><strong>Post-condition:</strong> Nathaniel found someone local that is able to create a 3d model of his broken faucet piece and print it with their 3d printer. He has reached out through the website for further information from this person.  </p>
            <ul>
                <lh class="fw-bold">Interaction Flow</lh>
                <li>Nathaniel spends some time scrolling through the landing page of the “Maker” site as he’s not sure what he’s looking for.</li>
                <li>None of the links on the main page seem to fill his needs, then he notices a search bar.</li>
                <li>He types “fabrication” into the search bar as he’s not sure what or who it is he’s actually looking for.</li>
                <li>Many categories come up from his search. He notices one for welders and metalwork. Nathaniel follows the button click to the listing for metal workers.</li>
                <li>None of these listings seem to fit what he’s looking for. So he go back to the search results and scrolls a little further down the list. He notices there’s a listing for “3d Printing”. He clicks on the 3d Printing button.</li>
                <li>A page comes up with about 20 Makers offering 3d printing services. He starts reading the postings. He clicks on the first listing he notices has pictures of mechanical/technical appearing 3d printed items.</li>
                <li>On the listings page, he notices a portfolio of this person’s past work. He also notices some pricing options and a review section. Nathaniel clicks on the review section.</li>
                <li>He scrolls through the reviews and notices this “Maker” has mostly positive reviews. He then clicks on the portfolio and looks at a few pictures. </li>
                <li>Nathaniel notices some pricing on the site but is not sure how this would apply to the faucet piece he needs to be fabricated. He notices a contact seller button and clicks on it.</li>
                <li>A small box pops up with fields to leave his contact information and a messagegit. He leaves his email address, phone number, and types a brief message requesting more information.</li>
                <li>Nathaniel hits the send button and exits the site. He eagerly awaits a reply from this well-reviewed local Maker!</li>
